Programming Assignment 1 Due: Sun Aug 1

Problem Write a Python program that asks the user for the dimensions (length, width, and height) of a room in feet, computes the total area of the four walls and ceiling, and determines the amount of primer and paint in gallons necessary to cover them (but not the floor!) The program should output the total area to be painted (in square feet), as well as the amount of primer and paint (in gallons) needed. Note: assume one gallon of primer will coat 200 square feet and one gallon of paint will cover 350 square feet.

Details Create an Excel file with at least five test cases. Use one row per test case with one column for the case's description, one column for each input, and one column for each corresponding output. Create a new Python file and place intro comments at the top (see template below). Use comments to write the algorithm your program will eventually follow. Write the Python code corresponding to each of your algorithm's steps. Test your completed code using your test cases. If the output doesn't match, correct your program.
